      Introduced in 2019, the Huracán EVO harnesses some of the latest and greatest modern technology and features on offer from Lamborghini. From the aerodynamics and powertrain to the multimedia interface Lamborghini have revised and re-engineered, bringing the EVO up to date. The new HMI (Human-Machine Interface) provides a new and simple way to access and navigate the different driving dynamics and entertainment functions onboard the EVO. The new information system incorporates an updated telemetry system with two cameras in order to track and improve your driving skills, on the track of course.
      <br><br>
      The aggressive styling of the EVO matches perfectly with the re-designed front and rear bumpers giving the Huracán a more modern appeal. The V10 in the EVO is taken straight from the Performante, producing the same power output. The powerful V10 exhaust note has now been even further enhanced with a more refined by means of a new titanium exhaust system – amplifying the special V10 sound. With a myriad of new features that ultimately increase driver engagement and overall performance, the EVO, is the Huracán in its pure form.

      Arguably the most anticipated car of 2021, the 992 GT3 receives aerodynamic upgrades that has made the seemingly impossible, possible. The 991 GT3 left very little room for improvement, but a 17 second quicker Nürburgring lap time produced by the 992 GT3 demonstrates the monumental gains over the practically perfect previous generation. This has been achieved by the Porsche engineers working tirelessly on the design to create the most amount of downforce possible. The new swan-neck rear wing is not only a work of art, but is also a functioning masterpiece, delivering up to 4 times more downforce than the rear wing of its predecessor. Put the wing in the performance aero setting and Porsche claim the 992 GT3 delivers twice as much downforce - for use on the track, of course.
      <br><br>
      To match the rear-end performance, the front suspension has derived from the 911 RSR. For the first time, the GT3 utilises a double wishbone setup which provides greater stability and more negative camber which in turn means the front tyres have more contact with the ground around corners. Combined with the wider front track, the 992 GT3 has more grip through corners and immediate steering response.
      <br><br>
      Porsche could have stuck turbochargers into the new GT3 like the rest of the 992 range, but thankfully the 4.0 naturally aspirated flat-six remains. Even with the GPF filters, the flat-six still sings all the way up to the 9000rpm redline. Individual throttle bodies have been added for the 992 to increase the throttle response, which was already razor sharp for the 991 generation.
      <br><br>
      The interior is one that we are now familiar with since the launch of the 992-model range, with everything important to the driver within effortless reach. Porsche always seem to be ahead of the curve with their production and track cars, the 992 GT3 being no exception to this, combining the best of both worlds into one precise and entertaining package.

      The Porsche 911 Turbo S has always been the definitive driving machine, consistently offering unparalleled all-round performance. The 992 generation has taken that package to the next level. A reworked version of the 992 Carrera engine sits at the rear with some additional features and changes of components including a wider bore, symmetrical turbos and piezo crystal injectors. These are just some of the upgrades that allow the Turbo S to generate 641 bhp, with Porsche claiming a 0-62mph time of 2.7 seconds. Keep in mind Porsche are conservative with their performance data, so expect this already impressive figure to be drastically reduced when you get behind the wheel.
      <br><br>
      All the interior features that are new in the 992-generation line are present in the Turbo S, with interior comfort being paramount. The seating position is low, providing a race inspired feel whilst still granting a good view of your surroundings. A 10.9” touchscreen display allows for quick and simple navigation through the responsive Porsche Communication Management System (PCM), with the new ‘WET mode’ accessible from the drivetrain mode select switch on the lower part of the steering wheel. Ultimately, the new generation Turbo S remains true to its roots by offering the ultimate combination of performance and comfort, allowing it to remain as one of the best all-round supercars on the market today.

      The 718 Spyder RS is a car that many believed Porsche would never build and is the most powerful and arguably the most important Boxster of all-time. Essentially a drop-top version of the Cayman GT4 RS, the Spyder features a lightweight fabric manually removable roof allowing driver's to enjoy the immense 4.0L naturally aspirated flat-six from the GT3 in a way they have never been able to previously.
      <br><br>
      With the small dimensions and immense handling carried over from the GT4 RS, the Spyder RS has been dialled back ever so slightly in terms of the rawness of the GT4 RS to make the car a bit more road friendly with softer suspension but losing none of the attributes of that high-revving visceral noise delivered from the engine that sits closely behind you.
      <br><br>
      Aesthetically, the front end, particularly when sporting the Weissach Package, has been subtly-yet-tastefully updated, with larger front grilles and the instantly recognisable carbon fibre bonnet. All of this, combined with significant weight savings and enhanced aerodynamics, combine to form a Spyder that is unlike any other.

      Perhaps the most hardcore SUV on the market today – the Lamborghini Urus Performante. Following on from their best-selling car ever, the new Performante aims to take the standard Urus and dial it up a notch or two to create an even more super SUV, raising the bar once again for what it means to be a performance SUV.
      <br><br>
      As the first in what is now referred to as the 'SSUV' (Super Sport Utility Vehicle) sector, Lamborghini seem to be several steps ahead of their competitors, and the Performante is no exception. Whilst other manufacturers are still playing catch up trying to beef up their SUVs to Lamborghini standards, Lamborghini have introduced one of the first track-focused SUVs with plenty of aerodynamics and racing inspired features that make it a mean track day toy, whilst remaining extremely capable on the roads as a daily car.
      <br><br>
      Powered by the same 4.0L Twin-Turbo V8 as the Urus, the Performante has received an upgrade in horsepower, now sporting 657bhp. Getting from 0-62mph in just 3.3 seconds, it’s hard to believe this is still an SUV at heart. New to the Performante is the addition of a Rally mode, a driving mode built to take the car off-road onto more loose and unstable surfaces. Not only is this mode a lot of fun, but it also gives a chance for the Performante to let loose and enjoy its roots as an SUV.
      <br><br>
      Overall, the Urus Performante is not a subtle car in the slightest. The Performante brings together aggressive Lamborghini styling, plenty of carbon fibre, a heavily track focused design both externally and under the hood, and a fresh interior full of luxury materials. This car showcases the ultimate in what Lamborghini has to offer in the SUV space, and an excellent benchmark for what could be a whole market segment of track SUVs.

      Introducing the Ferrari Purosangue, the first 4-door Ferrari ever produced and the most exciting addition to the SUV sector in many years. Ferrari have raised the bar for what a 4-door is capable of with what can only be perceived as outrageous performance bringing the Ferrari DNA to to this market for the very first time. Powered by a 6.5L naturally aspirated V12, with 715bhp, it has supercar-like performance, doing 0-62mph in just 3.3 seconds.
      <br><br>
      The four-wheel-drive system is operational from 1st to 4th gears, but from 5th to 8th the Purosangue is purely rear-driven, keeping to what has mainly been the RWD Ferrari tradition. Ferrari have introduced a brand new active suspension system which has been praised by journalists for allowing the Purosangue to handle and feel like a proper Ferrari but with the comfort of a GT car. There is also a new partnership with Burmester to create a 21 speaker surround sound system which is standard-fit and there are new options available previously unavailable on a Ferrari such as an electrochromic panoramic roof and massage seats. 
      <br><br>
      Whilst many of it's SUV rivals can point to parent companies to supply parts and performance, the Purosangue is a true Ferrari original and with it's name translating to 'Pure Blood' you can see Ferrari's intentions were to make this a thoroughbred Ferrari which keeps to it's roots but also increases the success and evolution of this iconic brand.

      The Roma coupe was called “the cleanest-looking Ferrari for a generation” but that was before we laid eyes on the Roma Spider which might just be the prettiest Ferrari of them all. The sleek curves running from the front arches to the rear lights are unmistakably Ferrari, while bringing a smoother and cleaner look than previous models such as the Portofino on which it was initially based on.  The looks, however, are not the only thing that has been updated for the Roma. It has retained the 3.9L Twin-turbo V8 from the Portofino, but with 20bhp extra, as well as a refreshed exhaust system for a more refined sound. Instead of using the Portofino’s 7-speed DCT gearbox, the Roma uses a variant of the SF90’s 8-speed DCT allowing for quicker acceleration and at higher gears, better efficiency and economy when cruising.
      <br><br>
      The interior of the Roma is where Ferrari have taken things up another level and whilst this remains a driver focused cabin it's clear that the updated technology and infotainment has become increasingly important, which is understandable with the Roma being one of the most usable and accessible Ferrari's in the model range. The centre console seemingly engulfs the driver, wrapping all the way around the dash and joining with the door cards whilst the traditional instrument dials have been replaced with a digital dash and the centre console boasts a newly-designed screen encompassing various features and optional extras.
      <br><br>
      The Roma Spider breaks from recent tradition by going with a soft-top roof which happens to be the first front-engined soft top Ferrari since the 365 GTS/4 and Ferrari have given special treatment to the Roma Spider to ensure it's not just a Roma with the top chopped off. The Spider gets its own dedicated chassis with a new rear bulkhead and redesigned sills and the soft top means that it's significantly lighter than the Portofino M which it shares some underpinnings with. The Roma coupe re-wrote the rulebook for Ferrari and was universally praised but with a Spider version we now have what could be classified as the perfect lifestyle Ferrari.

      A new era is upon Ferrari. The V6 era. For years Ferrari have displayed their combustion engine talent with their range of V12 and V8 engines but the new 296 has entered the frame as the first production Ferrari to feature their new twin-turbo V6 engine. This isn’t only a new engine for Ferraris road-car line-up, it is also a hybrid like its bigger brother the SF90 which the 296 leans heavily on for technology. The combined power output of the hybrid engine and turbocharged V6 is a monstrous 819bhp which is delivered to the rear wheels unlike the 4WD setup of the SF90.
      <br><br>
      The 296 has essentially dissected what constitutes a supercar and re-written the rulebook and in doing so has headed straight to the top of this new supercar category. A smaller sized engine paired to an electric motor would have never been seen as an avenue that Ferrari would ever stroll down, however the shift over to electric has felt like a natural progression ever since the LaFerrari arrived as their flagship hypercar.
      <br><br>
      Following closely in the footsteps of the 296 GTB, Ferrari added the drop-top to the range named the 296 GTS with the challenge to build on this hugely successful platform but with the added element of being able to take the roof off. The 296 GTS has been universally praised for being dynamically near identical to the coupe but adding open air thrills and in doing so has become one of the very best convertible supercars on sale.

      The Bentley Bentayga received a facelift in 2020, refining the exterior styling as well as upgrading to newer chassis & interior technology. The revisions to the exterior are subtle, but effective with a slightly more aggressive front bumper and rear tailgate. The small refinements have allowed the new Bentayga to create even more of a statement on the road than the pre-facelift model. Interior updates add tech such as USB-C connection points and wireless charging, keeping up with modern technology trends. The infotainment system has been modernised, with actions being performed quicker and providing a more intuitive user experience.
      <br><br>
      The handling, much like the pre-facelift seemingly defies the laws of physics. The minimal body roll allows the Bentayga to manoeuvre in a similar manner to its low-slung Continental brothers whilst eagerly adapting to all-terrain types. The Bentayga has carved out a niche in the SUV market, where it not only delivers on luxury, but also finds the perfect balance of performance.

      The First Edition was available during the first year of production for the 3rd generation Bentley Continental GT for both the coupe which launched in 2018 and the Convertible in 2019. Essentially a specification pack which cost £34,700 over and above the standard Continental GT, the First Edition includes various options as standard including the much sought after Bentley Rotating Display as well as the Mulliner Driving Specification, Touring Specification, City Specification and much more. The First Edition is best distinguished from the regular model by the various plaques and badging which include an exterior Union Jack badge, First Edition sill plaques and special embroidery to the seats. 
      <br><br>
      The Bentley Continental GT certainly looks the part, with a wide, long lower body design making the car look altogether sportier than the previous generation, whilst still retaining those trademark muscular rear wheel arches. The flowing lines of this car create a sense of speed and elegance even at a standstill with its bulging curves hinting at the power that lies beneath. With a drivetrain consisting of a heavily revised twin-turbocharged W12 mated with a slick 8-speed double-clutch gearbox, the Continental is no slouch as can be seen from it’s performance figures. As you would expect the interior is beautifully appointed and crafted with an array of the latest tech to keep you safe, comfortable and entertained whilst enjoying the silky ride thanks to the 3-chamber air springs on each corner and the Bentley Dynamic Ride system which uses electric motors to reduce body roll under cornering. The Continental GT has long been Bentley's signature model and it's popularity never seems to dwindle.

      The McLaren F1 GTR Longtail was a Le Mans race car based off the road-going McLaren F1. Only 10 were ever built including the prototype, with it winning its debut Le Mans race. The F1 GTRs huge success in racing therefore means motorsport heritage is tightly linked with the Longtail name, so it has only been delegated to the highest performing road-going McLarens. The revival began with the 675LT which was the higher performing version of the 650S, then the 600LT which improves on the 570S and now, we have the 765LT.
      <br><br>
      Building on the already ground-breaking 720S, the 765LT employs the same formula as the 675 and 600 Longtails. Power is raised from 710bhp of the 720S to 755bhp (765ps) of the 765LT. Weight saving, as always, is key for the Longtails. In this case, 80kg has been shaved from the 720S, which means the 765LT sits at 1,339kg in its lightest spec. A tailored suspension setup, polycarbonate glass rear-window, lighter wheels and an abundance of carbon fibre all contribute to the eye-watering performance of the newest Longtail in terms of pin-point handling and weight saving measures. 0-62mph is dealt with in a blistering 2.8 seconds, with a maximum speed of 205mph. A redesigned titanium exhaust system has been manufactured for the 765LT, where it not only serves for lightweight performance but also adds to the menacing looks of the rear with 4 separate exhaust tips, which allows the twin-scroll twin turbo V8 engine to breathe, creating a very distinctive sound.
      <br><br>
      Features from the Senna have been brought over to cope with the increase in power. The brake calipers, forged pistons and stronger head gasket have been borrowed from the Senna with upgraded oil and fuelling systems, ensuring the 765LTs extreme capabilities are supported with reliability and safety.
      <br><br>
      The 720S already stands out for all the right reasons. The 765LT takes these looks to the extreme with aerodynamically sculpted body panels and intakes, all maximising efficiency, reducing the drag coefficient whilst looking similar to an object from another planet. A more defined front splitter scoops and channels air to where the car most needs it. Every curve, aero flick and channel not only serves to benefit the cars looks, but also has the very important function of reducing turbulence and to dissipate heat quickly.
      <br><br>
      This latest addition to the Longtail department is one that successfully completes the important job of keeping the name alive by delivering an experience that like other Longtails, is unique and a step above expectations. This is a car that must be driven in order to fully appreciate the hours of engineering that McLaren have applied to the 765LT. We see this car only building on the Longtails successful heritage.

      The Aston Martin DBS Superleggera takes the already fast and super stylish DB11 and turns everything up a notch to create a profoundly different and special offering. Differences start with the engine. Although the Superleggera shares the same 5.2L Twin-Turbo V12 with the higher-powered variant of the DB11, a clever ECU remap has increased power output significantly, to an astonishing 715bhp. Other marked changes over the DB11 making the Superleggera instantly recognisable include the lower wider stance, far more aggressive louvred side strakes and one of the largest most imposing front grilles you are likely to see on the road. At the rear of the car a dual diffuser and fixed blown rear wing work in conjunction to add 180kg of downforce at top speed, whilst a full width rear light bar gives an ultra-modern appearance.
      <br><br>
      Superleggera, meaning “super light” in Italian, gives a clue that some weight savings may have been made, 72kg of them to be exact. This has been achieved through the use of carbon fibre on the clamshell bonnet, roof and boot lid, as well as all the additional aerodynamic features. Step inside to find one of the best interiors Aston Martin have produced in recent years. Highlight features include an electrically actuated lid for the sweeping centre console and a Mercedes infotainment system representing a quantum leap forward, as Aston Martin loyalists will know. Carbon ceramic brakes, adaptive damping and the rapid third generation Touchtronic gearbox make it fully apparent that this is far more than your average British GT cruiser. This is a fully-fledged super GT car, ready to take on the likes of Ferrari’s 812 Superfast and offer buyers a genuine British alternative.

      The Mercedes-Maybach S-Class sits in a class of it's own as the pinnacle of Daimler's limousine range thanks to it's longer body creating a uniquely spacious rear cabin in order to provide maximum relaxation for it's passengers. An understated luxurious saloon packed with the world’s best technology and an interior worthy of any private jet. The latest generation offers 2 engine choices with both a V12 and V8 producing different levels of power and economy. 
      <br><br>
      The S580 produces 503bhp from its 4.0L Twin-turbocharged V8 engine, whilst excluding elegance and refinement that make it the luxury car of choice. This is further accentuated by the First-Class Cabin option in which reclining seats with massage and ventilation are complimented by picnic tables, rear entertainment screens and of course the signature rear refrigerator and champagne flutes. The Mercedes-Maybach S580 offers a truly unique travel experience, basked in luxury but in a classy business-like package which continues the Maybach legacy which has long appealed to the very upper echelons of the world.

      Coming off the back of one of BMW’s most beloved and successful ‘M’ cars, the new M2 was highly anticipated and had big shoes to fill. Finally, in 2022, images and details of the M2 were released and it’s safe to say it was controversial upon first viewing. A design overhaul gives the M2 large, squared-off front grilles, new modernised headlights, a deeper, more aggressive rear bumper as well as other more subtle updates. 
      <br><br>
      As with most BMW M cars, the M2 is all about performance. It demonstrates this in bundles, with the 3-litre twin-turbo six-cylinder engine producing a staggering 460hp and an official 0-62mph time of just 4.1 seconds. This 0-62 time, however, has since been beaten by journalists, with some claiming the real-life figure to be roughly 3.9 seconds. Being rear-wheel drive, the M2 has a playful, twitchy character, but use of its widened stance and limited-slip differential keep it in check when you’re wanting to be slightly more sensible. To add to its personality, the M2 can be optioned with a 6-speed manual transmission – something scarcely found in performance cars today and something that will certainly appease the more traditional petrolheads.
      <br><br>
      The interior has had a dramatic update over the outgoing M2, with the introduction of a 12.3-inch digital cockpit alongside a 14.9-inch central display, a refresh to the overall layout and trim and a choice between sporty comfort seats, or the optional carbon fibre buckets which are included as part of the M Race Track Package. Alongside this comes carbon fibre interior trim, a carbon roof and the M Driver’s Pack which increases the top speed to 180mph. The rear of the cabin provides plenty of space for two adults, with the materials and quality being retained from the front and climate vents accessible to rear passengers.
      <br><br>
      The new M2 takes what was a fantastic formula for the original car and dials it up a notch in all aspects. Ludicrous power and performance result in a seriously fast, yet compact and playful 2-door coupe. The refresh to both the exterior and interior modernise the M2 and bring it up to date alongside other M cars in the range. The retention of the 6-speed manual box as an option proves BMW’s commitment to still make true drivers’ cars, leaving fans of the German manufacturer wanting for very little with this new M2.
